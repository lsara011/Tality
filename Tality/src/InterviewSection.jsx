            <strong>Highlight Your Soft Skills:</strong> 
            <p>
              Soft skills like communication, teamwork, and problem-solving are essential in hospitality. Provide examples of how you've used these skills 
              in past roles to deliver exceptional service.
            </p>
          </li>

            <strong>Dress Appropriately:</strong> 
            <p>
              First impressions matter. Dress professionally in attire that suits the role you're applying for. Whether it's formal wear or business casual, 
              make sure you look neat and presentable.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Ask Thoughtful Questions:</strong> 
            <p>
              Show your interest in the position by asking questions about the company culture, team dynamics, or growth opportunities within the organization. 
              This demonstrates your enthusiasm and eagerness to contribute.
