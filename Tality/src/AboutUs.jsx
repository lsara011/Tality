             At Tality, our mission is to make it
            easier for hospitality professionals to find job opportunities by
            providing direct access to applications in the industry. We aim to
            empower those who work tirelessly to keep the hospitality sector
            thriving by offering them a platform designed specifically with
            their needs in mind.
            <br />
            <br />
            Tality was founded by Luis Saravia, a software engineering student
            at Miami Dade College, with a passion for connecting his background
            in hospitality with technology. After majoring in Interdisciplinary
            Studies with a focus on Hospitality at Florida International
            University, Luis set out to create a platform that bridges the gap
            between these two distinct fields.
            <br />
            <br />
            The vision behind Tality is simple: to provide a straightforward way
            for hospitality professionals to find job opportunities by directly
            accessing applications for positions within the industry. We believe
            that those who keep the restaurant and hospitality world running
            deserve a platform that truly supports their career journey.
            <br />
            <br />
            What started as a simple idea grew into a project that took
            countless hours of dedication, challenges, cups of coffee, and a
            desire to give back to a community that has always inspired Luis.
            Tality is more than just a job portal; it's a tribute to those who
            make the hospitality industry what it is today.
